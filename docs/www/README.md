# CardboardCI

A collection of docker images that provide a common core for use in continuous integration.

The idea of these images is to balance the following:

- Frequency of updates
- Standard set of tooling
- Common Environment

## Status

I have just recently moved the project from GitLab to GitHub, and I am in the process of enabling GitHub Actions for all of the docker images. In the future I'd like for it to:

- Update the dependencies automatically
- Have sufficient documentation for each image (and how to use)
- Tests to verify that each image works
- Samples that verify each image is working as intended
